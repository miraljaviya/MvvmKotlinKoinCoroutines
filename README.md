Simple Example of MVVM architecture using Koin and Coroutine in kotlin 

I know there are many tutorials online explaining how to implement MVVM architecture in your Android Studio project.i try to implement some of Architecture components like Room, ViewModel, LiveData.
And now a days Coroutines are getting popular so i try it instead od RxJava.

</b>What are Coroutines?</b>
A new way of managing background threads that can simplify code by reducing the need for callbacks. Coroutines are a Kotlin feature that convert async callbacks for long-running tasks, such as database or network access, into sequential code.
