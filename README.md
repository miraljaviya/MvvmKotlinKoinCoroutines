# MvvmKotlinKoinCoroutines
Simple Example of MVVM architecture using Koin and Coroutine in kotlin 

I know there are many tutorials online explaining how to implement MVVM architecture in your Android Studio project.i try to implement some of Architecture components like Room, ViewModel, LiveData.
And now a days Coroutines are getting popular so i try it instead od RxJava.

<p>A new way of managing background threads that can simplify code by reducing the need for callbacks. Coroutines are a Kotlin feature that convert async callbacks for long-running tasks, such as database or network access, into sequential code.</p>

I’ve always used Dagger for Dependency Injection.Not only am I familiar with it, but everyone use it for.Then I’ve been seeing Koin quite a bit online recently, and like any new libraries and frameworks I was curious to see what it was all about. For this reason I decided to replace the use of Dagger 2 with Koin.
I did really enjoy using it.</p>


I know this is not the perfect sample app. There are much other good technologies and principles that haven’t been used in this project.
 If you have any new idea create/develop your own improvement by forking the project.
